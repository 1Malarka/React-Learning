# React-Learning
Every folder contains information about react, from basics to advanced.

What i learning could be found on that roadmap - site (https://roadmap.sh/react?fl=1)

# Requirements
every folder require vite, but bcs there's too many files in vite's folder, github don't wanna download them.
So as a solution https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sWbjYYMoFB7FUTR1k3Pkkol3EqvtLuoK/view?usp=sharing , i downloaded RAR file ay my disk
So you just have to download any folder, and unzip node_modules.rar to folder, and drag it to any folder (like first-react-site or others).

It would be like that

node_modules (folder) 
public (folder)
src (folder)
.gitignore (txt)
eslint.config.js (file)
index.html (file)
packages.json (file)
package-lock.json(file)
readme.md(file)
vite.config.js(file)
